* Hello folks!

  #+reveal: split
  If you've never heard of Rust...

  #+reveal: split
  I'll tell you what Rust is

  #+reveal: split
  How I got to know Rust

  #+reveal: split
  And some problems that the language helped me to solve

  #+reveal: split
  But if you've already heard of it...

  #+reveal: split
  I'll show you some steps to keep learning

* In 2015

  #+reveal: split
  I started to get involved with the deployment of some projects.

  #+reveal: split
  NPM + Python + Java + Closure Compiler + SCons + RVM...

  #+reveal: split
  I wanted a simple way to execute applications

** Objective
   1 cross-platform binary

* The Options

  #+reveal: split
  "Do I have to write in C for binaries?"

  #+reveal: split
  Rust was one of the options in my search for alternatives.

  Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

  "It's a very modern language

  with low-level focus"

  #+reveal: split
  A language with several functional-paradigm features:

  #+attr_reveal: :frag (t t t t t)
  - Immutable by default
  - No null or undefined
  - Pattern matching
  - Closures
  - Structs and Enums

  #+reveal: split
  # FIXME: Bruno, essa tradução lhe parece certo? Não entendi super bem por
  # quê mencionou o "seguir aprendendo"...
  What stood out to me for continued learning:

  #+attr_reveal: :frag (t t t t t)
  - Creates binaries
  - Cross-platform
  - Good error messages
  - Low-level focus
    - But with a high-level language experience
  - Sponsored by Mozilla

** [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/][Mozilla Quantum]]

   All of these traits create an ideal environment for proceeding with confidence

  How many bugs can happen in a low-level program?

  Rust has a type system that prevents several kinds of memory management errors at compile-time

  Add the dependency in the =Cargo.toml= file

  #+BEGIN_SRC toml

  #+END_SRC

* Changing our file

  Now let's see a little of Rust, bit by bit.
  Let's open the =src/main.rs= file.

  #+reveal: split
  First, we import and include some references to the web framework.

  #+name: import
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
    #[macro_use]
    extern crate nickel;
    use nickel::{Nickel, HttpRouter};
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split
  We include all of our HTML file content in a constant.

  #+name: index
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
    const INDEX: &str = include_str!("index.html");
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split
  We create a new Nickel server.

  #+name: nickel
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.get("/", middleware!(INDEX));
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split
  We configure the port with the =PORT= environment variable.
  Let's use port 3000 for fallback.

  #+name: port
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
    let port = std::env::var("PORT").unwrap_or("3000".into());
    let url = format!("0.0.0.0:{port}", port = port);
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split
  We start our server, with a message in case there are errors.

  #+name: start
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust
    println!("On {}", url);
    server.listen(url)
        .expect("Unable to start the server");
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split

  In the end we'll have this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC rust :noweb yes
    <<import>>

    <<index>>

    fn main() {
        <<nickel>>

        <<port>>

        <<start>>
    }
  #+END_SRC

* Now we can create our executable

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    $ cargo build --release
  #+END_SRC

  #+reveal: split
  And execute it:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    $ ./target/release/my-site-in-rust

    On 0.0.0.0:3000
    Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000

* "One question..."

** Is it easy to learn Rust?
   I spent weeks banging my head against some concepts that were new to me.

   #+reveal: split
   - I have a more high-level background (Ruby/Java/JavaScript)
   - I had to learn about the stack and references
   - The concepts of ~lifetimes~ and ~borrowing~ took a while to get into my head

   #+reveal: split
   Rust brought new concepts to my toolbox.

   And I've been having a lot of fun!

   #+reveal: split
   The community is very open and helped me a lot, and has a lot of interest in welcoming new people.

   Many people are willing to help on [[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rust-beginners:matrix.org][#rust-beginners]], on the [[https://users.rust-lang.org/][forum]], and even on [[https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rust-br:matrix.org][#rust-br]].

   #+reveal: split
   # TODO: Talvez seja mais esclarecedor dizer aqui que o material é para
   # programador.
   There's a big push to make the ecosystem inclusive, as much for community participation as for material for all levels.

** [[https://rustbridge.github.io][RustBridge]]
   An initiative to teach Rust to those that aren't well-represented in the area of technology

   #+reveal: split
   With interest in turning the language into a good first programming language

** Collaborative evolution
   All proposals for changes in the language follow an [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md][RFC]] process

   #+reveal: split
   which requires new proposals to have [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1636-document_all_features.md][documentation]] and a clear way to teach the change

** How do I get my site on Heroku?
   I used this [[https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust][buildpack]].

   #+REVEAL_HTML:  <img style="border: none;" src="heroku.png" />

** Is there only Nickel for web work?
   There are several frameworks, but it's an ecosystem that's still developing.

   #+reveal: split
   A good list can be found at [[http://www.arewewebyet.org/][Are We Web Yet?]]

   #+REVEAL_HTML:  <img style="width: 40%;" src="areweweb.png" />

*** If you are looking for something more experimental:
    Have a look at [[https://rocket.rs/][Rocket]], which uses a more succinct syntax...

    #+REVEAL_HTML:  <img style="border: none; width:70%;" src="rocket.png" />

    #+reveal: split
    But it depends on compiler functionalities that are still in development.

** Do I need to use rustup?
   It's the most recommended method by the community

   - It's the easiest way to stay up-to-date
