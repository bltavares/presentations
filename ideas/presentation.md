# Bridging ideas


## Ideas

Note:
This is about ideas. I wont kill ideas.
Bad ideas, good ideas, mutating ideas, merging ideas.
I might not agree with them.

I want to make an exercise: 
Pick a post it, write something you don't like on one side.
Write something you like on the other.

Save for it and we will come later to it


## Inheritance

Note:
That is how we perceive the world. Tends to be 'touchable'.
We are good at finding patterns and giving names to things help our mental model.
We had a full language based on that.
We can make if based on that.


## Mutable state

Note:
That is how we perceive our actions on the real world.
We tend to do things mutably, it feels natural.

We want to process data, transform, make decisions.
Lets imagine a small computer.

A computer needs to do lots of things. But it has only 4Mb of memmory.
It is used inclusive for loading your OS.
Creating millions of objects was not fesaible.
We had to improve our tools and prices to allow us to spawn loads of objects.


## Good vs Bad

Note:
Why is an idea good or bad inheritenly?
Exploring ideas is valid and healthy.


## Confront the current status
Note:
Is the best practice of the last year still best practice?
Is your development environemnt good enough?
Is your language good enough?


## "TDD is dead"

Note:
No tests, acceptance in another format?
Generative tests? Type system as a form o testing?


## Ideas vs real world

Note:
Some ideas are ahead of its time.
Some ideas are just for inspiration.
Some ideas are closre to solving current problems.

Some ideas need to be worked on to become real.
Vagrant, docker


## Explore because you can

Note:
[Cobol on WheelChairs](http://azac.pl/cobol-on-wheelchair/)
[Bash webservers](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/bash)
[Text editors written on a stripped down browser](https://atom.io/)
CoffeeScript: [Source Maps, Adopting browser as an target environment]


## Lets explore some ideas


## Workflow


## Better IDE

Note:
Ask question to your idea. Why is this this value? Where it is assigned
[Causal debugger](http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&context=hcii)
Let it download code examples


## Living on the runtime

Note:
[Debug mode is the only mode](http://gbracha.blogspot.com.br/2012/11/debug-mode-is-only-mode.html)
Live code evaluation for your page.


## Architectures


## REST

Note:
XML or JSON. Why not EDN or Yaml?
Why not no-http? message queues? sockets?
MVC? Model2


## Applications as libs

Note:
[The future of software, the end of apps, and why UX designers shouldl care about type theory](http://pchiusano.blogspot.com.br/2013/05/the-future-of-software-end-of-apps-and.html)


## Game inspiration

Note:
[Immediate-mode graphical user interface](http://mollyrocket.com/861)
React, No mvc, just render your data.
Game loop ~= Event loop

## Imutable data

Note:


## Events as data

Note:
Reactive Extensions, BaconJS


## Append only database

Note:
Combining the idea of imutable data, and dealing with events as data.
No locks.
We can reduce size with shared imuttable structures.


# 初心

Note:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin


## Look at the bright side

Note:
Try to see the good parts of ideas


## Look at the context

Note:
Contextual.


## Adapt
Note:
Try to bridge it to your context.


## Do things because you can
Note:
Exploring ideas leads to new ideas
